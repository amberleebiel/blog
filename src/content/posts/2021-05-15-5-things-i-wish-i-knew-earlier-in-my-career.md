1.) **You are more than your job.** We, as Americans, tend to overwork ourselves and often feel a sense of pride because of it. *I'm guilty, but working on it.* Early in my career, I never used all of my vacation days. I went to work sick, which seems crazy to think about during a pandemic. In my mind, I thought I was making myself more valuable to the company, but really, I was only burning myself out.

Americans also tend to define themselves by their careers. *Guilty again.* Years ago, during my time in radio broadcasting, my position was eliminated after my station flipped to a jockless format. I was fortunate when the company offered me a promotion if I moved to an undesirable city across the country, but it wasn't for me. I turned them down and was let go soon after. Eventually, my bruised ego and I found the right path.

It took me some time to realize that your job is only a part of you. You have family and friends who value you because you're kind and make the perfect face when something awkward happens. They love your sense of humor and the person you've become over the years. *Do they really know much about your job?*

2.) **It's okay to change your career goals if you're unfulfilled.** After losing my "dream job," there I was in my 20s, feeling like I was going through a mid-life crisis. I knew it was coming. I had knots in my stomach for weeks waiting, but not just because I knew I was going to lose my job.

Part of me was interested in leaving the broadcasting industry, ready for more responsibility and new challenges. Putting down roots was also appealing after living in 4 states in 7 years. However, I felt trapped by my own expectations. I accomplished something most of my college classmates didn't—I made it and worked in radio. *Guilt? Check.* I also felt pressure not to walk away from a career I worked hard and sacrificed to build. 

Truthfully, a small part of me still feels like a failure a few times a week because I didn't ultimately become the person I thought I'd be when I was a kid. That may sound silly, but it's true. I have to remind myself of the advice I'd give to anyone who is unhappy in their career: consider all of the skills you have and find a fulfilling path that fits you. That's what I did. Don't let "should" get in the way.

3.) **Any person who makes you feel less than is the problem, not you.** It's true in personal and business relationships. Don't surround yourself with people who make you feel small. Friends hear you, support you, and encourage you to be better than yesterday; genuinely great leaders do the same for their employees.

4.) **If a company offers you less than you think you deserve, counter.** I once sat across from a future boss who chuckled after I accepted his initial offer and said, "women never negotiate salary." In retrospect, this was probably a red flag. *Who would say that out loud and be happy about it?* Quickly after, a toxic workplace culture emerged; however, based on discussions with friends and family since that exchange, he seems to be correct more often than I'd like to think.

Feeling underpaid breeds resentment. Worse, many studies, including ones cited in an article from *[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health-advisor/feeling-underpaid-there-are-health-consequences-to-that/article23541907/)*, link feeling underpaid and undervalued with anxiety, depression, more frequent headaches, stomach pains, etc. *No, thank you*.

Instead, do your research and be prepared. Glassdoor's *[Know Your Worth](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/know-your-worth.htm)* tool helps you get a feel for your worth in the current job market. [Monster](https://www.monster.com/salary), [PayScale.com](https://www.payscale.com/), [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/), and many other sites offer the same free service. If you think you deserve more, counter.

Already in your position and underpaid? Politely make your case to your boss and present your research. Justify your request.

5.) **You need a creative outlet that has nothing to do with your job, even if you're in a creative field.** Side hustles and hobbies can be exhilarating and serve an essential purpose—changing your headspace. As people, we can become so focused on projects and our industry that we lose that creative spark because we're too close to the problem. Creativity stems from doing things differently, and if you never do anything different, how can you expect to keep being creative?

During the pandemic, I realized how much I missed writing for myself, longing for teenage nights when I stayed up too late just to feel my pen glide across the page. Hence, this blog and the ones to follow. Why not satisfy my desire and share some knowledge and insight with whoever is open to receive it?

What passion have you let extinguish? Get back into it for a month. I suspect you'll love how you feel, be inspired, and discover untapped innovation hiding within.
